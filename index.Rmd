title: "Introduction to R"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that makes data analysis easy for beginners. This workshop will introduce you the basics of using R for data science work. Through implementing a simple project, we will together work through a typical data analysis workflow: 1) import data; 2) manipulate data; 3) build models; 4) report results.
